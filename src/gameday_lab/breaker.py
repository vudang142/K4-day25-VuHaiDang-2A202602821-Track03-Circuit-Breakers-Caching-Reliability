"""Part B — Sliding-window circuit breaker that is safe under concurrency.

Differences from the textbook "open after 5 consecutive failures" breaker:

* trips on the failure *rate* over the last ``window_size`` results, and only
  once ``min_calls`` results are in (no tripping on 2 errors at 3am);
* treats *slow* successes as unhealthy (``slow_call_s``) — catches degradation
  before timeouts pile up;
* HALF_OPEN lets at most ``half_open_max_probes`` requests in flight; everyone
  else keeps failing fast (no thundering herd on a recovering provider);
* every admitted request gets a ``Permit``; results that come back after the
  state has changed (stale ``generation``) are ignored.

Tests: tests/test_breaker.py
