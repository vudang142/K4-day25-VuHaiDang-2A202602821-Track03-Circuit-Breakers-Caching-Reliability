"""Part D — Exactly-once *effects* for an agent workflow.

Two ingredients, and you need both:

1. **Idempotency keys** — a retry (or a re-run after a crash) of a side effect
   must reuse the *same* key, so the payment provider de-duplicates it.
   The key must be derived from *what* you are doing (session + step), never
   random per attempt.
2. **Checkpoints** — after each step succeeds, persist its result in the
   DurableStore. A fresh worker resumes from the last checkpoint instead of
   redoing (and re-paying for) everything.

Think hard about the ORDER of "execute step" and "save checkpoint".
Never catch ``WorkerCrash`` — it means this process is dead.

Tests: tests/test_executor.py, then `make workflows`.
